Object Detection API
Overview
The Object Detection API uses YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art deep learning model, to detect and classify multiple objects in images and video streams. It can be used for a wide range of applications such as security surveillance, inventory management, retail analytics, and more. The system identifies objects in real-time or from saved media files and provides bounding boxes with object labels.

Features
Object Detection: Detects and classifies objects in images and video.
Real-Time Processing: Supports real-time object detection from video streams.
High Accuracy: Detects multiple objects with high confidence.
Supports Multiple Objects: Detects various objects such as people, vehicles, animals, furniture, etc.
Customizable: Easy to integrate into different applications.
Technologies Used

Usage
The Object Detection API can be used either as a standalone application or integrated into other systems.

1. Object Detection Example
python
Copy code
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load YOLO
net = cv2.dnn.readNet("yolov4.weights", "yolov4.cfg")
layer_names = net.getLayerNames()
output_layers = [layer_names[i[0] - 1] for i in net.getOutputsNames()]

# Load input image
image = cv2.imread("path_to_image.jpg")

# Get image height and width
height, width, channels = image.shape

# Prepare the image for YOLO
blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(image, 0.00392, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)
net.setInput(blob)
outs = net.forward(output_layers)

# Process YOLO's output to draw bounding boxes for detected objects
for out in outs:
    for detection in out:
        scores = detection[5:]
        class_id = np.argmax(scores)
        confidence = scores[class_id]
        if confidence > 0.5:  # Adjust this threshold as needed
            # Get the bounding box for the detected object
            center_x = int(detection[0] * width)
            center_y = int(detection[1] * height)
            w = int(detection[2] * width)
            h = int(detection[3] * height)

            # Draw bounding box
            cv2.rectangle(image, (center_x - w // 2, center_y - h // 2), (center_x + w // 2, center_y + h // 2), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Show the resulting image
cv2.imshow("Object Detection", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
2. Object Detection from Video Stream
python
Copy code
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load YOLO
net = cv2.dnn.readNet("yolov4.weights", "yolov4.cfg")
layer_names = net.getLayerNames()
output_layers = [layer_names[i[0] - 1] for i in net.getOutputsNames()]

# Start video capture (use 0 for webcam or provide a file path)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Change to file path for video

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Get image height and width
    height, width, channels = frame.shape

    # Prepare the image for YOLO
    blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 0.00392, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)
    net.setInput(blob)
    outs = net.forward(output_layers)

    # Process YOLO's output to draw bounding boxes for detected objects
    for out in outs:
        for detection in out:
            scores = detection[5:]
            class_id = np.argmax(scores)
            confidence = scores[class_id]
            if confidence > 0.5:  # Adjust this threshold as needed
                # Get the bounding box for the detected object
                center_x = int(detection[0] * width)
                center_y = int(detection[1] * height)
                w = int(detection[2] * width)
                h = int(detection[3] * height)

                # Draw bounding box
                cv2.rectangle(frame, (center_x - w // 2, center_y - h // 2), (center_x + w // 2, center_y + h // 2), (0, 255, 0), 2)

    # Display the resulting frame
    cv2.imshow("Object Detection", frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
